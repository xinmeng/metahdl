\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{\&Depend} is no longer needed since \mhdlc{} automatically 
resolves dependency. 

\item \texttt{vpmake -depend} is not needed anymore, just give \mhdlc{} top level file and search path.

\item All \texttt{\&Force} should be converted to standard \vlog{} declarations, 
including 2D array. 

\item \texttt{\&ConnRule} and \texttt{\&Connect} should be converted according to 
\mhdl{} port connect syntax. 

\item \texttt{\&Instance} should be converted to \mhdl{} instantiation syntax.

\item \texttt{c-sky vperl\_off} and \texttt{c-sky vperl\_on} should be converted
to \texttt{rawcode} and \texttt{endrawcode}.

\item File extension is ``\texttt{.mhdl}'', not ``\texttt{.vp}''.
